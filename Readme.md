LDA
--------

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in javascript for node.js.
LDA is a machine learning algorithm that extracts topics and their related keywords from a collection of documents.

In LDA, a document may contain several different topics, each with their own related terms. The algorithm uses a probabilistic model for detecting the number of topics specified and extracting their related keywords. For example, a document may contain topics that could be classified as beach-related and weather-related. The beach topic may contain related words, such as sand, ocean, and water. Similarly, the weather topic may contain related words, such as sun, temperature, and clouds.
